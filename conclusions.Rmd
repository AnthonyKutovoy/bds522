## Conclusions
Although there do not appear to be statistically significant increases in average reviews of IPA or Sours between the 2008-2010 and 2011 periods, average reviews for Stouts show a clear positive trend between these two periods. Although my initial hypothesis that correlation exists between sales of a particular style and its reviews has not been confirmed, there is a possibility that a positive trend in average reviews could front-run the future growth in sales: while my dataset only contained observations through January of 2012, in recent years the sales of stouts have been [accelerating](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2018/11/07/Stout-the-fastest-growing-beer-style-in-the-UK). More analysis with observations over a longer period is needed to test this hypothesis.
