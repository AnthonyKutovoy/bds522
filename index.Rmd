## Introduction
With \$26 billion in US sales just in 2017 and growing at an annual rate of 5-8%
according to the [Brewers
Association](https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics/national-beer-sales-production-data/),
craft beer is one of the most exciting growth areas in the alcohol beverage
industry. In North America, various craft styles are manufactured by more than
3,000 breweries, which range in size from industry giants to brewpubs and
microbreweries, with the latter fueling much of the growth over the past decade
(source: Brewers Association):

In his article [What's the next
IPA?](https://www.brewersassociation.org/insights/the-next-ipa/) , Bart Watson
reviews a fascinating aspect of craft's recent explosive growth: popularity of
IPAs is the engine behind it, going from 8% to 27.4% of all craft styles between
2008 and 2015.

Armed with a dataset of over 1.5 million craft reviews from
[BeerAdvocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com/), I seek to investigate predictive
power of reviews focusing on 3 craft styles which originally comprised a minor
proportion of overall craft sales, prior to undergoing an explosive growth in
popularity: IPAs, Sours (as discussed by Watson), and Stouts as per [American
Craft
Beers](https://www.americancraftbeer.com/stouts-now-the-uks-fastest-growing-beer-style/).  
  
*My hypothesis*: during a slower growth period for craft style, statistically
significant positive trend in reviews over time forecasts future explosive
growth.
